                <b>Be The Good</b> was established in 2023. This charity has been
                operating under its former name, For the Love, since 2017.
                Be the Good will continue to support underprivileged students
                and families, as well as nursing home residents and other
                community members who are often unseen and unheard.

                        We don't have a warehouse where volunteers are continuously needed,

                        like sorting donations after big events, delivering holiday banners
                        to nursing homes, or wrapping Christmas presents, please reach out!
