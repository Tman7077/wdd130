                are able to make a donation to support your community,
                or want to give back in other ways, we have a project that will suit

                <h2>Birthday Boxes</h2>
                <p>
                    Donate party supplies to make a birthday party-in-a-box
                    for a struggling member of our community. Boxes will be donated to
                    food pantries around Colorado Springs.
                    <br><br>
                    Birthday boxes are more than just fun treats. They restore dignity
                    to those who feel forgotten, to those who are never celebrated.
                    They are a gift to children, teens, and adults! Help us start the party!
                    <br><br>
                    The items below are included in each box.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Plastic container with lid (6 qt. size)</li>
                    <li>Cake mix</li>
                    <li>Tub of frosting</li>
                    <li>Happy Birthday banner/sign</li>
                    <li>Package of balloons</li>
                    <li>Festive paper plates (5" diameter)</li>
                    <li>Festive napkins (5" size)</li>
                    <li>Optional: Candles & sprinkles</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Please also include one 9x13" disposable cake pan per box. We can't count on the recipients having access to baking dishes. Thank you!

                <h2>Summer Banners</h2>
                <p>
                    Each year, Be The Good supplies seasonal banners to
                    nursing homes and assisted living residents in our community
                    to provide a bit of cheer to those who need it most.
                    It's a simple act of kindness that goes a long way.
                    <br><br>
                    Create banners with a Summer theme. Banners (sometimes
                    called bunting or garlands) should be 3-4 feet in length.
                    Each flag on the banner should be 4x6" or smaller.
                    Pinterest has great ideas. This is a wonderful activity
                    for a youth group or women's event!

                <h2>Youth Helping Youth</h2>
                <p>
                    To celebrate Global Youth Service Day, Be The Good
                    will host a hands-on service event aimed at
                    the youth of Colorado Springs. We will have service projects
                    designed to benefit youth in the community and hope that
                    most of our volunteers will be youth!

                <h2>Every Dollar Counts</h2>
                <p>
                    Prefer to donate cash? Want to help but strapped for time?
                    Please consider making a cash donation.
                    No amount is too small, and every dollar will go
                    directly toward serving members of our local community.
