        Hey guys! My name's Tyler. I live in Colorado Springs, and have since I was a kid.
        I'm living with my family at home right now, working, and preparing to head back to Idaho on-campus
        next semester. My degree is in Computer Science, and this is my third semester so far. It's been a while,
        though, since I came home and then went on a mission to Brisbane, Australia.
        But it's good to be starting school again!
    </p>

        I like to work with computers, and I actually built a computer last fall, which I am very happy with.
        I also like to run, but not competitively, and I'll sing in choirs for fun :). Other than that, I'm
        not all that interesting. I work for an In-N-Out, which has been a great job for the time I have been there.
    </p>

        I'd like to get a little more practice with website development, particularly the visual aspect,
        through this course. I don't have much experience with that, as my only time working with HTML was in a
        Javascript class I took before my mission (and we all know I don't remember much of that a few years later).
        I look forward to meeting you all!
    </p>
